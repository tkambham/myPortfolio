                                loss by taking preventive measures. We have used Convolutional Neural

                                of the project is to enhance the accuracy of weather predictions by incorporating both spatial 
                                and temporal dependencies in the model.</p>

                                Forest Regression model to get the best accuracy for my model. For the front end part of the 
                                project i ahve used React.js and also Material UI.</p>
